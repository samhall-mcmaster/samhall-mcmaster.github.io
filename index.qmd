I am a neuroscientist at Harvard University. I investigate the neural coding schemes and computational algorithms that the brain uses to generate intelligent behaviour. Originally from Aotearoa New Zealand, I completed my PhD at the University of Oxford, focusing on interactions between motivation, neural coding, and cognitive control.
